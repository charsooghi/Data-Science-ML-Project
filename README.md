# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
Selected projects I have done during my new journey in data science and machine learning

##  Warm-up Micro Projects
These are some micro projects in ML including:

### House Price Prediction
Supervised, Linear Regression
### A theory of Extramarital Affairs
Supervised, Logistic Regression
This micro-project is based on the data set from a survey of women by Redbook magazine at 1974. Married women were asked if they have had extramarital affairs or not.
Here we try to find any correlation between questions in questionare such as marriage rate, age, years married, number of childern, religious, occupation and ...
More information can be found in the published work by Fair, Ray in 1978 in Journal of Political Economy [Fair1978]

It is important to note that this data comes from a self-reported survey, which can have many issues as far as the accuracy of the data.

### Iris Flower Classification
In this micro project the different species of iris flower would be classified. The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper [Fisher1936], which is also known as or Fisher's Iris data set.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Titanic: Apply Machine Learning to Predict Survaival
This is my notes on Titanic challenge in Kaggle site (www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
This challenge is perfect for the guys who wants to get familiarized with ML and does a real life project. 
It is including:
- Data Visualization


## Todo List:

#### in House price prediction
[ ] Add some notes on project at the top of its jupyter notebook.  
[ ] Add some notes about values of estimated coefficients.
