# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
Selected projects I have done during my new journey in data science and machine learning

##  Warm-up Micro Projects
These are some micro projects in ML including:
### House Price Prediction
Unsupervised, Linear Regression

## Titanic: Apply Machine Learning to Predict Survaival
This is my notes on Titanic challenge in Kaggle site (www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
This challenge is perfect for the guys who wants to get familiarized with ML and does a real life project. 
It is including:
